<h4>NATIONAL PARKS AND MONUMENTS</h4>
<p>Saguaro National Monument is one of more than 175 units administered
by the National Park Service, U. S. Department of the
Interior. They include such outstanding scenic areas as Grand Canyon
and Yosemite National Parks and other Parks and Monuments
set aside for their scenic, scientific, historic or archeologic values.
These superb areas are yours and are a part of your heritage as
American citizens.</p>
<p>The National Park Service has the job of preserving the Parks
and Monuments in their natural, unspoiled condition and of making
them available for your enjoyment in such a manner as to leave them
unimpaired for the inspiration of future generations. To achieve this
high purpose it has been necessary to prohibit such activities as
woodcutting, hunting, grazing, mining and even flower-picking. The
men in the uniform of the National Park Service are here to serve
you, and will welcome the opportunity to make your stay at Saguaro
National Monument more enjoyable.</p>
<p>We hope you will cooperate with us &ldquo;by taking only pictures and
inspiration and leaving only footprints and goodwill.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>TIPS TO PHOTOGRAPHERS</h4>
<p>Photographers will note that several trails have been laid out for
their convenience. These lead to particularly fine specimens and
groups of Saguaros, but have not been developed as permanent trails.
They are merely guides to the better photographic locations.</p>
<p>The best time to photograph the Cactus Forest is late in the afternoon
when the lengthening shadows make the cactus stand out in
bold relief. Excellent views of the forest, with the Santa Catalina
Mountains in the background, may be had from the hilltops as you
drive north on the loop road. The Arizona sun is brighter than you
think, so use a light meter.</p>
<h4>CONSERVATION&mdash;CAN A LAYMAN HELP?</h4>
<p>If you are interested in the work of the National Park Service and
in the cause of conservation in general, you can give active expression
of this interest, and lend support by aligning yourself with one of the
numerous conservation organizations which act as spokesmen for
those who wish our scenic heritage to be kept unimpaired for the enjoyment
of future generations.</p>
<p>Names and addresses of conservation organizations may be obtained
from the ranger.</p>

<h3 id="c1"><i>THE NATIONAL MONUMENT</i></h3>
<p>In 1933 President Herbert Hoover by presidential proclamation
created Saguaro National Monument. Within its boundaries is
found the magnificent forest of mature Saguaros that is recognized as
the finest stand of this great cactus in the United States. It is one
of the few National Monuments dedicated to the protection and preservation
of a native plant species.</p>
<p>It is also one of the most diversified of our National Monuments.
With an altitudinal range of over 5,000 feet its 63,000-acre area
encompasses the peaks of two mountain ranges. Against this background
of towering mountains the cactus forest is presented as a
rare jewel mounted in an incomparable setting.</p>
<h3 id="c2"><i>THE GIANT CACTUS</i></h3>
<p>The Saguaro (<i>Carnegiea gigantea</i>) is the largest cactus native to
the United States. Common in northwestern Mexico, its range north
of the border is limited to southern Arizona, with the exception of a
few isolated small colonies along the California side of the Colorado
river. It grows on low desert plains and foothills in the hot dry
climate of the Lower Sonoran Zone. A prominent feature of this desert
landscape is the great variety of xerophytic (especially modified
to exist on limited water supply) plants, especially the cacti. In response
to the arid conditions under which it must survive the Saguaro
exhibits a degree of adaptability equalled by few plants anywhere.</p>
<p>The construction of the Saguaro is simple, yet effective. The stem
is supported by an inner framework of from 12 to 30 slender vertical
ribs. Arranged in a circle and joined at various places these ribs form
an openwork tube that possesses great strength and rigidity. In and
around this tube is a spongy tissue capable of absorbing a great
amount of water. This is facilitated by the accordion-like pleats of
the interior surface of the stem. These extend or close together as
the moisture content of the plant increases or diminishes.</p>
<p>The roots that serve this living storage tank are no less remarkable.
The tap root is small and acts as little more than a pad to support the
great weight of the plant. The radial roots are heavy and of great
length. They radiate out from the base of the Saguaro, usually no
more than a foot below the surface of the ground, but often to a
distance equal to the height of the plant. They serve the double purpose
of gathering food and moisture, and of holding the great bulk
of the trunk upright against the fierce desert storms. In their progress
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
through the rocky soil in which the Saguaro usually grows they
become contorted and act as anchors which are not easily dislodged.</p>

bright days closes about 10 the next
morning. They attract swarms of insects,
which in turn lure many birds.

and blooms in May and June.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The associations of the Saguaro with other plants of the desert
have not as yet been fully studied. However, it is apparent that for
the first years of its life the young Saguaro seedling requires the protection
furnished by a shrub or tree. Here it makes slow but steady
progress until at 50 years of age it may be 10 to 12 feet tall. During
the next century it may attain a height of 40 feet and a weight of
several tons, dwarfing its protector of former years.</p>
<p>The ecological importance of the Saguaro to animals is better
known. Two species of Woodpeckers, the Gila Woodpecker and
the Gilded Flicker, drill deep holes into the plant and fashion
nests in the cool interior. Actually this causes little damage to the
Saguaro, which soon forms a thick scar tissue around the walls of the
excavation, sealing it away from the rest of the plant. In succeeding
years these nests may be taken over by Elf Owls, Sparrow Hawks,
Flycatchers, or Purple Martins. Larger birds build their nests among
the branches of the Saguaro. Chief among these are the Red Tail
Hawks and Great Horned Owls.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>CACTUS FOREST DRIVE</i></span></h2>
<p>While at Saguaro you will find it is desirable to take advantage
of the recreational and educational facilities provided for your use.
After you leave the Administration Building, signs along the 9.1-mile
loop road will direct your attention to special exhibits along the way.
Each area has been chosen because of features especially interesting
to the visitor. Limited exploring and hiking trips are encouraged
along Cactus Forest Drive. A picnic area provided with fireplaces,
tables and ramadas is located at the 8-mile point.</p>
<p>Among the many stops along the Cactus Forest Drive five have
been selected as especially important to an understanding of the
natural features of the Monument. Each has &ldquo;in place&rdquo; information
which will add to your appreciation of the Cactus Forest.</p>
<h3 id="c4"><span class="sc">First Stop</span></h3>
<p>ROCK PARAPET&mdash;Approximately 200 years ago prevailing
climatic conditions were of such nature as to permit germination of a
large number of Saguaro seeds, creating the more or less even-aged
stand of Giant Saguaros we see here today.</p>
<p>The Tanque Verde Mountains to the east are composed largely
of crystalline rocks formed under conditions of great heat and pressure.
They were elevated by movements of the earth&rsquo;s crust and now
are gradually being eroded away.</p>
<p>The Tucson Valley to the north is in reality a deep canyon (2,000
to 3,000 feet) filled with debris.</p>
<h3 id="c5"><span class="sc">Second Stop</span></h3>
<p>CRISTATE SAGUARO&mdash;This abnormal growth, called a cristate,
is of rare occurrence. Many theories have been advanced as to
what causes these &ldquo;crests&rdquo; but none hold true in all cases. Although
the cause is unknown, the pattern of their growth is simple. Instead
of growing in three directions the cells of a cristate grow only upward
and outward in two. This results in a fan-shaped malformation
with a long growing line in the center of the upper edge. Although
a cristate may apparently develop from an injury, there is every
reason to believe that, once established, the tendency to cristate becomes
a genetic character. Seed from cristates often produce cristate
plants. An excellent specimen of cristate Barrel Cactus may be seen
at the entrance to the Nature Trail.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><span class="sc">Third Stop</span></h3>
<p>NATURE TRAIL&mdash;Along this 300-yard trail you will find most
of the important plants native to the Cactus Forest. Each plant is
labelled with both common and scientific names, together with much
additional information.</p>

Javelinas (or Peccary) often hide during the day to escape from the

particular area due to the abundance of Jojoba bushes.</p>
<p>From the view point near the Javelina Den a striking view may

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
